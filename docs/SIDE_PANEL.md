# Side Panel Migration

The extension uses the **Chrome Side Panel API** (Manifest v3); the UI runs in the side panel (no action popup).

## Summary of changes

- **manifest.json**: No `default_popup`; `side_panel.default_path` is `"index.html"`; `sidePanel` permission added.
- **background.ts**: `chrome.action.onClicked` opens the side panel via `chrome.sidePanel.open({ tabId })`.
- **Entry point**: `index.html` loads `main.tsx`, which mounts the **SidePanel** component (`src/sidepanel/SidePanel.tsx`) — the full extension UI. SidePanel is the single app entry; the legacy `App` component is unused.
- **Vite**: Single build entry `index.html`; `base: "./"` keeps extension asset URLs correct.

## How to test in Chrome

1. **Build the extension**
   ```bash
   pnpm run build:extension
   ```

2. **Load unpacked**
   - Open `chrome://extensions`
   - Enable "Developer mode"
   - Click "Load unpacked" and select the `dist/` folder

3. **Open the side panel**
   - Go to any tab (e.g. a supported listing site)
   - Click the FlatFlow icon in the toolbar  
   → The side panel opens with the full extension UI.
   - You can also right‑click the icon → "Open side panel" if your Chrome version shows it.

4. **Verify behavior**
   - Panel stays open when clicking the page or other Chrome UI.
   - Closing the panel and clicking the icon again reopens it.
   - Content scripts and messaging should work as before (same extension context).

## Domain restriction (myhome.ge only)

The side panel is **enabled only on myhome.ge and www.myhome.ge** (http or https). Elsewhere it is disabled and the icon click does nothing.

- **Why the icon sometimes didn’t open the panel:** Chrome can open the side panel automatically when the icon is clicked (`openPanelOnActionClick: true`). In that case `action.onClicked` is **not** fired, so our code never ran. The fix is to call `chrome.sidePanel.setPanelBehavior({ openPanelOnActionClick: false })` so the click is delivered to our listener; we then check the tab URL and call `chrome.sidePanel.open()` only for myhome.ge.
- **host_permissions** use `*://myhome.ge/*` and `*://www.myhome.ge/*` so both http and https are allowed.

## Common MV3 + Side Panel pitfalls

1. **`action.onClicked` only fires when there is no default popup**  
   With no `default_popup`, the icon click is handled by the background script. If you re-add a popup in the manifest, the click would open the popup and `onClicked` would not run.

2. **Tab context**  
   `chrome.sidePanel.open({ tabId })` opens the panel for that tab. The side panel page runs in extension context; use messaging (e.g. `chrome.tabs.sendMessage`, `chrome.runtime.sendMessage`) to talk to the active tab or content scripts.

3. **Service worker lifecycle**  
   The background script is a service worker and can be terminated. Avoid keeping long-lived state only in the worker; use `chrome.storage` or the side panel page for state.

4. **Paths in the side panel page**  
   The side panel is loaded as `chrome-extension://<id>/index.html`. Vite’s `base: "./"` makes script/asset paths relative, so they resolve correctly. For links to extension pages, use `chrome.runtime.getURL("index.html")` (or the right path).

5. **Chrome version**  
   Side Panel API is available from Chrome 114+. Ensure your target Chrome version supports it.

6. **Panel size**  
   The side panel has a fixed width (set by the user). Design your UI to work in a narrow column (e.g. avoid wide tables or fixed large widths).
